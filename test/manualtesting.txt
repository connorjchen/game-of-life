Manual Testing

Since most of our game uses randomness and user input, we did extensive 
manual testing by running "make play". For our manual testing we tested the
helper functions used in the gamestate turn function. For our tests we looked
at the the state of players before a turn and after a turn. For example, we 
checked to see how plaayer's account balances changed or if cards were added 
or removed from their deck. We numbered all our tests for specific functions
and included a description of what we were testing and looking for and a list
of test cases. For each test case we included the inital condition or input and
an expected and actual output. Additionally, we also tested our cards data 
and tiles data by printing the lists of each to terminal. We checking that
there were 131 tiles and they had the right constructors. We also made sure 
that all the career cards, house tiles, share the wealth cards, and long term
investment cards were included. After testing the JSON extraction of cards
was correct we commented out the printing of the data to terminal, since it 
is not needed for playing the game.
